# ExcelVBA
Projects using Excel and  VBA macros to automate repetitive tasks such as data entry, data manipulation, and report generation, which can save time and reduce the risk of manual errors.

Some examples are:

**Split a dataset, create a PDF file, and email it as attachment:** Macros: **“splitReport()”, “CreateAndEmailPDF()”**. These macros will split a dataset and create an individual report in PDF format for every incumbent and email it to themselves.

- **Use case:** General & Administrative reports (G&A) where data must be validated by distinct incumbents. Here the information is usually extracted/received as a big report with department expenses and must be split for validation between incumbents. 

**Compare two files:** Macro: **“Compare()”**. This macro will compare the contents of two workbooks cell by cell and highlight differences between them.

- **Use case:** Employees bulk salary changes. Where information goes through interfaces from one system to another there is a need to audit for accuracy.
